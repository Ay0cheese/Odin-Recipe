    <p>No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are <em>juicy</em>, and spices 
        can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Baste 
        frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the 
        eat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it 
        forms patties that hold their shape.</p> 
    <h4>Lets get started baby!</h4>
