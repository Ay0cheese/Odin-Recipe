        <h1>Here how we make it</h1>
        <p><strong>This ceviche recipe</strong>, a classic no-cook summer appetizer, works with any fresh fish fillet with mild flavor, like halibut or snapper.
             Be sure to pick up plenty of limes to squeeze—you’ll need 1 1/2 cups to marinate the fish. Afterwards, toss the “<em>cooked</em>” fish with 
             plenty of tomatoes, onion, green chiles, olives, cilantro, and avocado for layers of freshness and flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh, skinless snapper, bass, halibut, or other ocean fish fillets, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 medium white onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li> 
            <li>2 medium-large tomatoes (about 1 pound), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>Fresh hot green chiles (2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapeños), stemmed, seeded and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (manzanillos for a typical Mexican flavor)</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh orange juice or 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced</li>
            <li>Tostadas, tortilla chips or saltine crackers, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, 
                lime juice and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow 
                it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish. 
                Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer 
                looks raw when broken open. Drain in a colander.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives 
                and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and season with salt, usually about
                 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not
                  serving immediately. Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.</li>   
        </ol>
